# Project Name: The App App
# The purpose of this project is to create an appointment booking app for
# companies that provide services such as a salon, a personal trainer, or a
# personal driver. etc. It would allow the service provider to enter their
# availability in a calendar and allow customers to schedule appointments for
# services. The app would then send either an email or a text notification to
# the service provider that an appointment has been booked.
